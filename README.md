Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - Neighborhood Map Project
================================================================

What is it?
-----------
This project uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to create a map of my neighborhood. A list of places will be marked on the map. In this case, coffee shops and other places for food or drinks will be marked. The categories for these places will be included in the app, and when clicked, will show or hide the list of places for that category. It will also include a text input field that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection. It will include a list view of the places on the map, which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a search filter is applied. Clicking a place on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker. Clicking a marker displays an info window with unique information about the location.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, download the project here: https://github.com/abgregs/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map-project

Load index.html in your browser to view the app (not working yet).

I'm currently just getting started on the project and troubleshooting an issue with getting my places lists organized for each category and for the marker icon to display on the map according to the category. This is a work in progress and will be updated as it moves closer to the final product.

The project currently contains an `index.html` and folders containing `styles.css` and `app.js` respectfully. Within the js folder, the Knockout.js library is also included. This will eventually be used for binding data and refreshing our UI for the search filter and list view features.
