Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - Neighborhood Map Project
================================================================

What is it?
-----------
In this project I used the Google Maps JavaScript API to create a map of my neighborhood. I triggered search requests to generate areas of interest and then mark them on the map. The theme for the areas of interest is food and drink. The categories for the places are included in the app, and when clicked, will show or hide the list of all places belonging to that category. The map also includes a live search feature that filters a list view of the places to display only those places matching the text input. This list view will update with each key stroke of the text entered in the search input. All locations will be displayed on the map and the names listed in the list view by default. Clicking a map marker or the place name in the list view displays unique information about the location in an info window and also animates the selected marker.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, download the project here: https://github.com/abgregs/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map-project

Load index.html in your browser to view the app. Some features may not be created and styles not applied yet as this is still in development.

This README is a work in progress and will be updated as it moves closer to the final product.

The project currently contains an `index.html` and folders containing `styles.css` and `app.js` respectfully. Within the js folder, the Knockout.js library is also included. This is used for binding data and refreshing our UI based on interactions from the user.
